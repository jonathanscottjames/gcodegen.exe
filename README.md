v1.7 actually works the way it's designed. F1 for help and instructions. 
After you start the program, 
press F2 then select an area of the screen with the mouse. The selected area will be grayed out  While selecting.
push "windows key" + "P" to start scanning. 
Press F1 for help..  press windows P to start converting. If it's working properly then after a few seconds you'll see the green marker Tracing out the black areas of the diagram you're converting.
press "windows key" + "S" to enable the statistics display. it shows how many pixels are being converted which is somewhat im[ptyant because it uses an average of 20 bytes per pixel.. and the file is not small.. .. it also uses 3 lines of text for each pixel.. and actually running it on a milling machine can take more than an hour... yet the results are not bad, and if you use a drill bit instead of an end mill. it would seem to be  the only way to make anything. however most 3018's come eith a flatmil wgich is a combination of drill and endmil. .. i hope to make it render a version that can deaw a line or mill an entire area without lifting the tool.. i have decide it should search for the next pixel by spiraling till it hit's a non black pixel oruse the last pixel before going vack in the direction it came from.. well i better do it instead of talking abbout it.. thanks for reading.. 

(Sometimes After marking the area on the target window it shifts positions,, use alt tab to get it back or switch it back on the taskbar after it's marked).. I don't know if Windows security will deprecate this one like it did the last one. Press escape to exit the program. Or reset the computer If you don't know how to press the escape key ESC. .
